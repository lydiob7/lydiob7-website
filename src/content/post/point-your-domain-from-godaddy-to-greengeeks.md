Follow these simple steps to seamlessly point your domain from GoDaddy to GreenGeeks and streamline your website management process.

## 1 – Login to your GoDaddy account and look for your domain

Once you logged in to your [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com) account you will see a screen with all your purchased domain names.

Click on the domain name you want to point to your server.

## 2 – Look for the “manage DNS” settings

Inside your domain settings page you will have to look for the “manage DNS” option. In [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com) you can click on “Domain” on the left hand side menu.

Then click on “Manage DNS”

## 3 – Edit Nameservers

Now you are in the DNS settings section of your domain, here is where you can manage all the different types of DNS configuration. We are only looking to change the “Nameservers” to point our domain name to [**GreenGeeks**](https://www.greengeeks.com/track/u167472) and let them manage all the DNS for this domain.

First click on the tab “Nameservers”.

And then on the button to Change Nameservers

A popup will appear where you can put the new Nameservers. In our case, since we want to point this domain to [**GreenGeeks**](https://www.greengeeks.com/track/u167472) we will use the following Nameservers provided by them:

- ns1.greengeeks.net
- Ns2.greengeeks.net

Check the option “I’ll use my own nameservers” and insert the two urls on the text fields like this.

And that’s basically it on [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com), if you purchased the package to host your landing page with [**Itakhi**](https://itakhidigital.com/) just let us know by sending a message to [contact@itakhidigital.com](mailto:contact@itakhidigital.com) and we will take over the rest of the process. Otherwise if you are hosting your landing page yourself you can log out and go to your [**GreenGeeks**](https://www.greengeeks.com/track/u167472) account. Continue reading this post for the next steps.

## 4 – Login to [GreenGeeks](https://www.greengeeks.com/track/u167472) and add a new domain

When you login to your [**GreenGeeks**](https://www.greengeeks.com/track/u167472) account you will see the summary page. On the left hand side menu you will find “hosting” which is the section to manage your hosting settings. In this menu “Domain” refers to the domain names you buy inside [**GreenGeeks**](https://www.greengeeks.com/track/u167472) (which you can totally do as well) but since we are learning how to point a domain from an external provider to our server we need to click on “Hosting”.

Welcome to GreenGeeks

You will enter your hosting settings area where you will find access either to the cpanel (which we won’t view today) and to [**GreenGeeks**](https://www.greengeeks.com/track/u167472) own managing panel. Click on “Manage”.

Manage hosting account

In here you’ll find the tab “Domains” and in the submenu you will have to choose “Addon Domains”.

Managing domains

In the Addon Domains section you can enter the domain name you previously pointed to this server and click on “Add Domain”. If everything goes well you will see your domain on the list below.

Addon domains

And that’s about it!

In conclusion, successfully connecting your domain to hosting is crucial for establishing your online presence. By following these detailed steps, you can seamlessly point your GoDaddy domain to GreenGeeks and manage your website efficiently.

Remember, while the process may seem straightforward, DNS changes can take time to propagate across the internet. Patience is key as you await the full activation of your domain on your hosting platform.

We hope this guide has provided valuable insights and assistance in navigating the domain-to-hosting connection process. If you encounter any difficulties or have questions along the way, don’t hesitate to reach out to the Itakhi  for support.
