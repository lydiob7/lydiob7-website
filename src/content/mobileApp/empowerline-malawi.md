excerpt: Designed by the Gender and Justice Unit (https://genderandjustice.org/) to empower Malawian women by providing accessible, simplified legal information.\n EmpowerLine Malawi is a mobile application designed to empower women in Malawi by providing accessible, simplified legal information to enhance access to gender justice. The app addresses the critical need for clear and relevant legal resources for women, especially those who have experienced violence or face legal challenges related to family law, property rights, workplace rights, and more. As a comprehensive resource hub, the platform supports users in understanding their legal rights, accessing emergency contacts, and utilising a chatbot for navigation and legal guidance, with a specific emphasis on improving access to gender justice.
